# cra-template-ts-empty

This is a fork of the [official TypeScript template](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/master/packages/cra-template-typescript) for [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), but doesn't come with the placeholder React logo. So you don't have to clean up your new project first, before you can start with your own code.

To use this template, add `--template ts-empty` when creating a new app.

For example:

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app --template ts-empty

# or

yarn create react-app my-app --template ts-empty
```
