# cra-template-ts-bootstrap

This is a fork of the [official TypeScript template](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/master/packages/cra-template-typescript) for [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), but doesn't come with the placeholder React logo. So you don't have to clean up your new project  before you are able to start coding.

To use this template, add `--template ts-bootstrap` when creating a new app.

For example:

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app --template ts-bootstrap

# or

yarn create react-app my-app --template ts-bootstrap
```
